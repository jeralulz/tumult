# Something compelled me to do this

I actually have no exact use case for it but I didn't find anyone having done it either, so here I am.
This is the thinnest wrapper to make working with Discord Webhooks just a tiny bit less annoying than straight up calling `Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body...`


Where am I heading with it? I don't know either.
